			<h3>Design Elements</h3>
          <p> In a man’s world, where women often ignore themselves to please men, we want to empower woman in their solitary, because women do not need a man to make them cum. All they need is their own big ego (egasm).
              Egasm values love for yourself as a strong empowered woman. Self-respect has nothing to do with sex or nudity, self-respect means making choices that make you happy. We value the courage to be single, independence to a level of egoism. Unapologetic egoism for the love you feel for yourself as a woman. </p>
