			<h3>Design Elements</h3>
          <p> For the font of the website we made use of font-family: 'Archivo', sans-serif and font-weight: normal. We made the desicion to use one basic simple font, because our brand is simple and sophisticated. Next to the edgy photo´s we use on the website we wanted to have a font that was clear, but would not take the attention away from the images. Our colour pallet contains five types of red colour. Egasm is a sexual brand, it represents lust, power and warmth. We made use of two light cream colors and three deep red colours. These are the base colours of our website, like containers and backgrounds. Besides the base colours we made use of colourfull images of our sextoys. With the use of a deep red we gave the website a sexual feel witout taking the attention away from the sextoys. </p>

			<h3>Evidence of Testing</h3>
<p> For the prototype testing, we asked 3 participants if they can order something and go to the page where they can find an overview of his/ her order. We also asked them if they can send a message to our support team through the contact page, and we told the participants to look through to look through the design page. We asked the participants to think out loud, so we know what their thought process is. We also did a testing round with a real prototype, where we asked the participants to look through the website.

			<h3>Outcomes of Testing</h3>
<p> Based on the outcomes of testing the paper prototype we found that the it was unclear on where to find the basket. We have placed the basket now into the navigation bar where people can see their order when they click on it. They also found that the web-shop page was not clear enough, meaning that the they could not find what the price is  and they did not know where he could put it in the basket. We changed it to a page where there are 3 products next to each other with their prices and a button where people can add their products into the basket. Someone also pointed out that there was no option to remove an item from the basket, so we put in the option where people can remove or add an extra product that they already have in their basket. When people were looking through the website prototype someone said the images in the basket page are too small, so we changed the pictures from 70x70 to 100x100
